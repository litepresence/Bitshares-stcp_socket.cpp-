was targeted as low hanging fruit for revision by large languge model

containing only 117 lines of code 

and the low D score in reliability here:

it is of significant complexity requiring high pay scale understanding

I'm a python dev, my c++ understanding is maybe c+ at 101 level on a good day

The following changes were implemented via iterative discussion with chatgpt.com 4a mini

wtfpl litepresence2024

### Header Inclusion and Namespace

  Second Version: Adds several new headers `(<memory>, <vector>, <stdexcept>, <iostream>, <mutex>)`,
  which indicates a shift toward using C++ features like smart pointers, exceptions, and
  mutexes for thread safety.

### Class Structure and Member Variables

  Second Version: Fully encapsulates stcp_socket as a class, with private member variables.
  This enhances the codeâ€™s modularity and encapsulation.

### Buffer Management

  First Version: Uses raw pointers and manual memory management for _read_buffer and _write_buffer.
  
  Second Version: Introduces std::shared_ptr for buffer management and a new method
  allocate_buffers(size_t size) for buffer allocation, improving memory safety.

### Thread Safety

  Second Version: Uses std::mutex for thread safety in methods like readsome and writesome.
  This is an important improvement for concurrent environments.

### Error Handling

  First Version: Uses assertions and rethrows exceptions in some places.
  
  Second Version: Introduces structured error handling with try-catch blocks
  and logs errors via a log_error method.
  This approach provides more informative error messages and maintains robustness.

### Code Simplification
   
  Second Version: Uses std::vector<char> for the serialized key buffer
  instead of raw memory allocation. This simplifies memory management
  and reduces the risk of memory leaks.

### Functionality Changes

  Input Validation: Both versions check for buffer sizes being multiples of 16,
  but the second version uses exceptions to handle invalid lengths, which is a cleaner approach.
  
  Error Logging: The second version includes a dedicated method to log errors,
  which could be beneficial for debugging.

### Const-Correctness

  Second Version: Maintains const-correctness in methods like eof() const,
  ensuring that they do not modify the state of the object.

### Miscellaneous Improvements

  Constexpr: Introduces BUFFER_SIZE as a constexpr, improving readability and maintainability.
  Private Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator:
  
  The second version explicitly deletes the copy constructor and assignment operator,
  preventing accidental copies of the socket object.

  The second version is well commented. 

### Summary

The second version demonstrates significant improvements in safety, maintainability,
and usability over the first version.

It employs modern C++ features such as smart pointers, mutexes, and structured error handling,
making it more robust for concurrent applications.

The changes not only enhance functionality but also improve the overall design of the code.
