1. Header Inclusion and Namespace
First Version: Includes specific headers needed for the implementation.
Second Version: Adds several new headers (<memory>, <vector>, <stdexcept>, <iostream>, <mutex>),
which indicates a shift toward using C++ features like smart pointers, exceptions, and
mutexes for thread safety.

2. Class Structure and Member Variables
First Version: Directly defines member variables without encapsulating them in a class structure.
Second Version: Fully encapsulates stcp_socket as a class, with private member variables.
This enhances the codeâ€™s modularity and encapsulation.

3. Buffer Management
First Version: Uses raw pointers and manual memory management for _read_buffer and _write_buffer.
Second Version: Introduces std::shared_ptr for buffer management and a new method
allocate_buffers(size_t size) for buffer allocation, improving memory safety.

4. Thread Safety
Second Version: Uses std::mutex for thread safety in methods like readsome and writesome.
This is an important improvement for concurrent environments.

5. Error Handling
First Version: Uses assertions and rethrows exceptions in some places.
Second Version: Introduces structured error handling with try-catch blocks
and logs errors via a log_error method.
This approach provides more informative error messages and maintains robustness.

6. Code Simplification
Second Version: Uses std::vector<char> for the serialized key buffer
instead of raw memory allocation. This simplifies memory management
and reduces the risk of memory leaks.

7. Functionality Changes
Input Validation: Both versions check for buffer sizes being multiples of 16,
but the second version uses exceptions to handle invalid lengths, which is a cleaner approach.
Error Logging: The second version includes a dedicated method to log errors,
which could be beneficial for debugging.

8. Const-Correctness
Second Version: Maintains const-correctness in methods like eof() const,
ensuring that they do not modify the state of the object.

9. Miscellaneous Improvements
Constexpr: Introduces BUFFER_SIZE as a constexpr, improving readability and maintainability.
Private Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator:
The second version explicitly deletes the copy constructor and assignment operator,
preventing accidental copies of the socket object.

Summary
The second version demonstrates significant improvements in safety, maintainability,
and usability over the first version.

It employs modern C++ features such as smart pointers, mutexes, and structured error handling,
making it more robust for concurrent applications.

The changes not only enhance functionality but also improve the overall design of the code.
